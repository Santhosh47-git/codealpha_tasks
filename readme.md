📈 Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
A tool to manage and calculate the total value of a stock portfolio based on predefined prices.

Key Features: User input for stock symbols/shares and CSV file export.

Concepts Used: Dictionaries, File I/O (CSV), error handling (try-except).

⚙️ Task 3: Task Automation Scripts
Automating repetitive real-life tasks to increase productivity.

Key Features: Automatically organizing files by extension or extracting emails from text files using patterns.

Concepts Used: os, shutil, and re (Regular Expressions).

🤖 Task 4: Basic Chatbot
A rule-based chatbot that can interact with users and answer basic queries.

Key Features: String cleaning (lower().strip()), time-checking integration, and fallback responses.

Concepts Used: Conditional logic (if-elif-else), loops, and string methods
